1
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,170
The Antarctic continent is the highest,
windiest,

2
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,280
driest and coldest continent in the
world. It contains around ninety percent

3
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,420
of the world's ice and thereby seventy percent of the
world's fresh water

4
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,100
 and is home to giant active volcanoes

5
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,460
enormous subglacial lakes and rocks over
four billion years old

6
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,040
It is one of the few places in the world
that has never seen a war

7
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,049
where the environment is fully protected
and science has priority

8
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:06,689
The coast of Antarctica is dotted with
research stations from over 40 different countries

9
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,740
and is home to an international community
of scientists

10
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,869
some of whom are stationed on the
continent all year round

11
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,920
The interior of Antarctica is a vast
expanse of ice

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,420
in some places four kilometres thick. The
continent's divided in two by the Transantarctic mountains

13
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,610
high up on the polar plateau of east
antarctica

14
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,950
lies the South Pole, the goal of the
majority of tourism and expeditions that happens in the continent

15
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,700
It is the location of a giant US science base

16
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,320
These are the Ellsworth mountains in
West Antarctica

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,579
The highest mountain range in the whole
continent

18
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,829
They consist of the northern Sentinel
range and the Southern heritage range

19
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:02,819
The Heritage range is home to numerous
glaciers that flow down from the West Antarctic Plateau

20
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,990
One of which is called Union glacier, it is a large heavy crevassed glacier

21
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:11,750
86 kilometers long and nine kilometres
wide

22
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,270
and is the site and Union glacier camp

23
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,240
The camp is operated by Antarctic
Logistics and Expeditions

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,460
and is open for three months during the
Antarctic summer

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,420
It's situated near Union glacier blue ice runway

26
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,140
A naturally-occurring stretch of blue ice

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,459
ALE uses various types of aircraft
to operate in Antarctica 

28
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,400
A large Russian Ilyushin jet runs
intercontinental flights from Chile

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,140
and transports the majority of heavy
cargo and passengers to the camp

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,340
 A Bassler BT 67 and two de Havilland Twin Otters are used to fly within Antarctic

31
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:52,730
Both these aircraft are fitted with skis
and can land almost anywhere

32
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,590
For three months each year Union glacier
camp acts as a logistics hub for

33
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,449
scientists,

34
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,480
tourists,

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,280
South Pole teams,

36
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,000
 and climbers

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,480
And ALE provide support to both private expeditions

38
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:06,929
and national Antarctic programs. 

39
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,880
Every year movies are made, books written and stories
told of the expeditions that pass through the camp

40
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,880
This film is about the people who play a
part in making that possible

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,450
but in particular it is about the 10 people who
make up the Union glacier start-up crew

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,110
The start-up crew are a small team

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,160
that land in the pristine glacier ahead of
everybody else and a thousand kilometers from the nearest science base

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,580
It's their job to start setting up the
runway and camp for the season ahead

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,930
My name is Nigel Blancao I come from England

46
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,130
I work at Union glacier as a vehicle mechanic

47
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,130
My name's Ant. I'm the UG chef

48
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,390
I'm from England and this is the freezer

49
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,970
My name is Monica

50
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm from Canada and I fly the Twin Otter 

51
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm Mike from Canada

52
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,290
I'm an aircraft maintenance
engineer eh

53
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:27,210
My name's Tom Weston I'm from the UK

54
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,550
my job is travel safety guide

55
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Hi I'm Celine I'm from Ireland and my job
here is Comms operator

56
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,300
My name's Ian

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,650
I'm from North Yorkshire. My job here is

58
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,110
water, electricity and heating

59
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:51,840
Yo soy Boris. I am from Chile, Puenta Arenas Pacific.
My work here is

60
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:54,809
operator, mainly working in the blue-ice
runway.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,180
My name is Al, from Yorkshire UK and my job is

62
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,259
mechanical services manager

63
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:07,399
And I'm Alex and I'm a copilot on the Twin Otter

64
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:58,899
The staff members change every season so
it's not always the same people flying in early

65
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:04,279
This year in addition to the 10 staff a
two-man expedition team that headed to the South Pole

66
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,039
has already passed through the camp
leaving the expedition manager

67
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,739
and filmmaker behind to get the first Ilyushin flight back to Chile

68
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:30,039
The weather is supposed to clear up the
next couple of days so until then

69
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,859
we've offered to help out with setting
up the rest of the camp

70
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,509
The blue ice runway is where the Ilyushin
lands and takes off

71
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,180
it's a hundred meters wide 3,000 meters
long

72
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,620
and the whole of Union glacier camp
exist because of this runway.

73
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,340
It's a rare section of ice that
doesn't accumulate new layers of snow each year

74
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,640
and as a result can take
and craft with much heavier loads.

75
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,130
the whole stretch a of ice has to be
cleared of snow before the Ilyushin can land

76
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,360
ALE have a large pair of
industrial snow blowers

77
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,480
but with strong winds blowing loose snow
down from the mountains almost every day, it's a difficult job

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,580
The weather in Antarctica can change quickly and dramatically

79
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,220
and blizzards can cause white-outs which
smother the campaign in almost zero visibility

80
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,900
These are four-season mountaineering tents
which are used by the staff

81
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,970
These double-walled clam tents are used for
clients and guests

82
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,169
This is the start-up tent which has
stayed on the ice all winter

83
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,770
It's heated by a stove and all the meals
for the start-up crew are served here

84
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,690
This is one of several vehicles which
stays on the glacier all year round

85
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,199
These are four Ski-Doos

86
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,770
This is the Twin Otter. The plane that flew the first staff members onto the ice

87
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,090
It has a crew of three and is operated by
Kenn Borek Air

88
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,830
These are washing lines for drying
clothes

89
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,830
These are drums of aviation fuel

90
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,820
which nearly everything in the camp runs
on

91
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,240
This is the Comms box, the communications hub of the camp

92
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,040
It's situated next to a large radio mast to improve signal

93
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,639
These are the toilets. There are separate ones for men and women

94
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,959
and aren't particularly warm at all

95
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,180
Most things in camp are within walking distance,

96
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,570
but in bad weather it's often easier to
use a Ski-Doo to get around

97
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,170
Antarctica may hold the record for the
coldest temperature ever recorded,

98
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,200
but right now it's approaching the
Antarctic summer

99
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,890
so the climate is comparatively mild.
Sometimes when the skies are clear

100
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,530
and the wind dies down, you can get away
with being outside in just a couple of thin layers

101
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,160
The staff call this a Dingle Day.

102
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,880
But this season winter temperatures are
lingering and working outside can still be a challenge

103
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,740
Right now the temperatures minus 25
degrees Celsius

104
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,340
A lovely day sitting on the porch
enjoying the weather and the beautiful view

105
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,020
That's my favorite

106
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,010
Yeah the weather is definitely spot-on
here

107
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,600
The weather doesn't really affect me because I've got a nice warm cab to drive around in

108
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,780
All I have to do is turn the heat up a little bit

109
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,800
Seems to affect everyone else with their hats on and coats. Looks very cold out there

110
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,740
It's about minus 25
degrees centigrade at the moment

111
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,100
The wind is blowing probably 20-25 knots.

112
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,700
Probably about -40 wind-chill. You definitely want something on the end of these when you're working outside

113
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,010
It takes a couple days to get used to it
after I having a summer back in Canada

114
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,870
but a couple of days and it feels like normal

115
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,840
Not too bad, I'm from the North, I'm alright

116
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,780
You've got loads of gear on, just wrap up warm

117
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,240
When you can go inside it's great

118
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,380
I have four layers on top, two layers
on the bottom

119
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,889
One, two, three, four, five

120
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,000
Five on my top. And two on my legs

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,700
On my head I have my toque. My toque and my hood

122
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,340
Balaclava, woolly hat, hood, goggles

123
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,120
Pull it down over your face

124
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,600
it gives your face some sort of protection against the wind

125
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,160
which really bothers my
cheeks and nose. And then put a hat on top which keeps your head warm

126
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,560
Most of the staff have boots rated for use in temperatures as low as minus a hundred degrees Celsius

127
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,260
Despite their warmth they still need
regular drying out in front of the stove

128
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,780
to stop sweat freezing to the boots'
insulation layers.

129
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,680
This is the freezer. It's a shipping
container that has been sunk into the ice

130
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,490
and is accessible by makeshift shaft.
It contains all of the frozen food that has

131
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,390
been left in storage whilst the campus
closed during the winter

132
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,760
The start-up crew bring a few supplies with
them from Chile

133
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,440
but the majority food stocks will arrive
with the first Ilyushin flight

134
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,180
So until then Ant has to work with
whatever he can find here

135
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,080
I found a Beef Fillet!

136
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,060
Probably the biggest thing I do at
the moment is making water

137
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,360
Cooking, cleaning, washing-up.

138
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,710
Basically just feeding the start-up crew.
Breakfast, lunch and dinner

139
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,900
Kind of just giving them as varying meals as I can think of with what I've got

140
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,540
Ant cooks three hot meals a day,

141
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,010
but the crew can also have snacks in
between. This is a tube of Kryzpos

142
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,500
They're a Chilean brand potato chips known
by the staff as crazy-poos

143
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,170
There's also lots of wine
to go with the evening meal

144
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,589
but nobody will recommend it much. The
most important is that the chef

145
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:05,080
is fantastic. He's his marvelous, always making the

146
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,770
food here so I am very very happy with
everything working in the kitchen.

147
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,980
Well, the food is fantastic

148
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,100
It shows

149
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,680
Just excellent

150
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,240
The food is excellent, Ant is a Super Chef

151
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,410
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

152
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,340
Really? That's really nice, isn't it? That's really nice of them

153
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,860
Flags are used to mark where
the main road runs through the camp

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,520
The camp covers a sizeable area of the glacier

155
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,100
And the staff use a multitude of vehicles to to move equipment and travel from one part to another

156
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,040
This is a Ski-Doo

157
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,100
Nigel will tell you what everything else is because he's much more qualified

158
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,370
ALE have a fleet of these wheel vans they are on low gappage tires

159
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,200
Which enables them to drive over the snow. We mainly use them to ferry clients from the blue ice runway back to camp

160
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,200
But we do use them occasionally to get out and about and do some expedition work locally 

161
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,030
This is a Tucker Snow Cat. It's four
wheel drive, it's on tracks

162
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:25,200
We use it around camp as a general work horse. It's got a blade on the front so we can bulldoze snow and groom areas

163
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,480
It can tow implements and groom surfaces

164
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,830
It carry cargo in the back, and also again, it goes out on exhibitions locally

165
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:38,420
This is a Prinoth BR 350 snow groomer.
We use it as a snow groomer around camp

166
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,800
and down at the blue ice runway

167
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,400
We also use it as a traverse tractor 
which enables us to tow about forty tonnes of cargo out into the field

168
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,480
We use that as fuel laying depots for our planes or on science expeditions

169
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,230
Favourite? I'd go for the BR

170
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,490
I's just more adaptable, it can do more things

171
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,590
The comms box is also the hub for all
weather information

172
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,180
Meteorologists use the data gathered
from automatic weather stations down on the blue ice runway

173
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,160
and compare them with satellite imagery to
provide wind and weather updates to flight crews

174
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,870
climbers and expeditions on the ice.

175
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,760
Everyday Celine receives a new weather update

176
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,990
it's the same weather information
the crew of the Ilyushin are using in Chile

177
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,860
For the first flight of the season

178
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,220
the pilot won't fly unless the
conditions are perfect

179
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,120
He needs good visibility

180
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,300
 good contrast

181
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,920
and low wind speeds

182
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,800
and he also won't want the Sun in his eyes when approaching the runway

183
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,940
Which rules out a night flight

184
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
 This weather window must last for the time it

185
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,670
takes to fly from Chile to Union glacier and back again

186
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,100
and include the time it
takes to unload and reload any cargo

187
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,850
About a 12-hour round-trip

188
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,450
There's already a sweepstake amongst the
crew as to when it will land

189
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,450
3:30 on November 3rd

190
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,760
p.m.

191
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,070
I guess it could be another at least
three days

192
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,180
No comment

193
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,800
sorry

194
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,000
During an average season

195
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,260
Union glacier camp can expect around 350
to 450 visitors

196
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,700
The camp can house just over 100 people
at any time

197
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,830
and is made of a PolarHaven tents most
of them need to be assembled from scratch

198
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,650
but a few left intact over winter these
need to be dug out

199
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,330
and shifted into the right position

200
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,470
Until the weather improves

201
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,790
there will be no fresh food deliveries
and the camp will need to be set-up

202
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,410
by just the twelve people on the ice

203
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,860
So to put one of these big tents up, first
we have to level the snow

204
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,280
then we lay the floorboards, join them all
together

205
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,300
attach the frames, bolt that down

206
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,460
and then the big covers go on

207
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,270
and they're a multi-person job

208
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,179
tie them down and put the windows in, and
there we have it, a lovely

209
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,519
tent in Antarctica

210
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,340
Each of the PolarHaven tents are heated
by large stoves that runs on aviation fuel

211
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,340
And each tent connected to a solar panel
outside that

212
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,890
provides electricity for the staff and clients

213
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,979
these panels also supply energy to the snow melters in order to make hot water for cooking

214
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,419
And to strengthen the tents against strong winds

215
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:50,499
deep holes are drilled into the snow to secure guide ropes

216
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,159
This one's the dining tent it's gonna 
attach onto the kitchen

217
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:14,989
and it'll feed about a hundred people when it's full

218
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,029
I quite like washing-up

219
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,380
What's wrong with it Tom? It's dead!

220
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,610
Can you fix it?

221
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,140
I know a man who can

222
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,260
Who's that?

223
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,559
Best part of the job is fixing things and

224
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,760
sense of achievement. The downside
of the job is probably having to go

225
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,090
outside in the cold

226
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,610
and things generally breakdown in the
worst weather conditions

227
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,620
The worst thing about the job is
just missing family and friends at home

228
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,950
The staff can use satellite phones to call
people back home,

229
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,739
but it can be costly

230
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:37,440
and it's cheaper to send an email

231
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,330
I'm gonna be here for four months this
time

232
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,600
and missing Christmas and missing my family

233
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,300
Ian's birthday is at the beginning of the season

234
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,500
so as well as Christmas and New Year,
he spends it working at Union glacier

235
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,020
Happy Birthday Ian!

236
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Thank you Tom

237
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,880
It's curious to know what he might want for
present

238
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,400
down here, in Antarctica

239
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,600
Dancing girls!

240
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,840
Well he likes ice cream as well

241
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,730
But I haven't got any egg yolks

242
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,200
Happy Birthday. That's yours, that one is yours

243
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,590
Anty made me a cake

244
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,679
The 3 rules of Ski-Dooing are:
Always drive when you can see

245
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,840
Attach yourself with the kill-corde,
and never drink and drive, kids!

246
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,920
The 3 rules of riding in a sled are:

247
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,650
Never exit a moving vehicle

248
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,490
Keep your hands and feet in at all times

249
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,020
And trust your driver!

250
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,820
During the Antarctic summer the Sun
never sets on Union glacier

251
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,670
it just skirts the horizon sometimes
ducking behind the mountains

252
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:19,000
but always providing enough light so the
staff never have to use a torch in their tents

253
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
When the wind picks up

254
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,710
it blows snow off the nearby mountain
tops. It takes a short while,

255
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,400
but eventually the wind reaches the camp
itself

256
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,880
As it advances, it creates a whirl of loose fine grain snow like a soft mist flowing over the glacier's surface

257
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,760
It is known as spindrift

258
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,000
Late at night when the Sun is low in the
sky and lighting the mountain ridges from behind,

259
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,740
the snow roles gently off the slopes
of the high peaks and down into camp

260
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,820
It is one of the most beautiful sites
that can be seen in Antarctica

261
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,540
Here's the latest weather report: snow, and cold.

262
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,470
For some of the start-up crew

263
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,809
this is their third or fourth season working
in Antarctica. Amongst the team

264
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,919
Nigel holds the longest record for being
on the continent

265
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,789
an impressive 24 seasons some are from
over summer

266
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:18,270
and some over winter. Sometimes for an
entire year straight through

267
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,370
it adds up to a total of over nine years.

268
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,000
I think the Ilyushin is going to land on... Friday

269
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,500
Tomorrow, no Friday, yeap

270
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,200
Friday

271
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Friday I reckon

272
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:00,659
While some of the crew thinking about the
delayed plane or maybe being at home

273
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:04,369
Boris has imagined an entire planet
that he can escape to

274
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:08,649
He calls at Planet Boris

275
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,600
So, Planet Boris, what's happening on Planet Boris today?

276
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,440
All right, now that the weather's cleared up a bit and the wind's died down

277
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,680
I thought I'd give you a quick tour of the Twin Otter

278
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,300
This is a de Havilland Twin Otter series 300 that is currently on board skis

279
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,140
This is the left propeller. This is
the inside of the Twin Otter

280
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,150
Contrary to popular belief these are not my training wheels

281
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,700
These are full drums of jet-fuel that we tie to the wings

282
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,420
for days like today when the wind
is blowing pretty hard

283
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,900
We have Bush-Style seats, which fold-down

284
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,940
This is the tail-section

285
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,620
We can take 19 passengers and we have
about four and a half hours range

286
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,909
without our fairy tanks

287
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:50,009
this is the right propeller

288
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Nose cone

289
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,880
This is the cockpit of our Twin Otter

290
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,500
I forget the number but there's like 500
pounds, no not even

291
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Hold on, erase that part. This much

292
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,630
Pogo Stick

293
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:14,000
The Twin Otter can be outfitted with, Floats, Wheels, Wheel-Skis and Board-Skis

294
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,000
The most common load is about
3,000 to 4,000 pounds of freight or people

295
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,340
We generally work in Antarctica on
Board-Skis that can land in

296
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:30,460
just about anywhere on the continent, but other than that it's pretty standard stuff

297
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:35,909
And that cocludes the tour of the Twin Otter. Stay classy Antarctica.

298
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,100
To stay in touch with each other everyone
carries one of these VHF handheld radios

299
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,820
It can be used around base, on the runway and in some of the vehicles

300
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,500
Boris, Boris, Tom.

301
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,500
Boris, Boris, Tom.

302
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,700
Tom, Tom, Tom, Boris.

303
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:20,100
Ah, Boris yes. What is a Donkey with three legs?

304
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,000
Dunno

305
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,800
Wonky.

306
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,590
When the clouds around camp clear you
can see the huge mountain ranges that

307
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,980
surround Union glacier

308
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,920
Though not visible from the camp itself

309
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,350
it is only 150 kilometers to the foot
of Mt. Vincent

310
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,470
the highest mountain in Antarctica

311
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,650
which people come from all over the
world to climb

312
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,510
Monica will now point out some other
noteworthy peaks

313
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,510
These the Enterprise hills

314
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,620
This is Mt. Rossman

315
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,369
That tall peak there is Mt. Dolence, which is the highest peak in that range

316
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:10,369
Just in front of that is the Connell canyon

317
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,500
Out in the distance you'll see elephant's head. When we have better visibility you can see the shape of an elephant's head

318
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,780
We're hear at Union glacier camp. Elephant's head is down here

319
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,330
Parts of the ice that makeup Union glacier believed to be a hundred and eighty thousand years old

320
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:41,550
It is recommended by some of the staff as
the perfect accompaniment to glass of scotch

321
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:27,349
Coming in after a really cold day and
having a cup of tea that's probably the best bit

322
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,100
Waking up in the morning with frost on your sleeping-bag,

323
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,979
isn't so great, but it's quite amusing at the same time

324
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:39,079
I can imagine the guys with longer beards.
you know I wonder if ever get stuck to their sleeping bag

325
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,749
I think it does, I think it gives a little bit of a buffer
you don't have to

326
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:54,710
worry too much about the wind burn on
half the face

327
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,100
It ices up a bit when you get some wind

328
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,030
Overall, I feel it makes me a bit warmer

329
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,080
Polar wisdom has been a mixed affair
regarding beards

330
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,700
The icons of the Heroic Age of Antarctic
exploration were almost all bearded

331
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,630
and it's an image that many modern-day
explorers model themselves on

332
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:24,760
Whilst on expeditions Ernest Shackleton and Captain Falcon Scott championed large frost-encrusted beards,

333
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,400
whilst the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen

334
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,420
famously preferred a closely-trimmed look or even clean-shaven

335
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,980
he wrote in his journal: "a beard in the
polar regions

336
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,250
seems to me to be just as awkward and
unpractical

337
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,870
as walking with a tall hat on each foot."

338
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:49,039
Well, I haven't shaved in about
10 years, but I do trim

339
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:55,700
This length is probably about four or five months worth of growth

340
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,880
maybe a bit more

341
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,900
There's Myself

342
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,120
Alex

343
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,400
Boris

344
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,500
Tom

345
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Ian

346
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Nigel

347
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,520
I don't think...

348
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,360
I don't think Al has one, he's the only one
without one.

349
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,009
Boris, Boris. Tom.

350
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:34,990
Um, yes Tom.

351
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,320
What do you call a donkey,

352
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,060
with three legs and one eye?

353
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,890
Winky Wonky

354
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,500
These are the fuel drums behind the
toilets

355
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,130
all human excrement in Antarctica has to
be removed and flown off the continent

356
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:08,610
as a result staff and clients sometimes
end up accompanying their own waste back to Chile during the flight home

357
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,360
The forecast
is still not good enough for the Ilyushin flight

358
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,949
but the Twin Otters can fly in the short
windows of better weather

359
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,099
There are no clients to ferry around

360
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,659
but fuel depots can be laid on the ice
for use later in the season

361
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,680
It's difficult not to be envious of the
flight crew, they get to travel around

362
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,089
the entire continent

363
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:36,029
and in doing so see some the best views
in Antarctica and there are many places on the map they won't fly

364
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,180
Union glacier is here in the Heritage Range

365
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,550
We fly clients around to
different

366
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,010
destinations for instance the South Pole

367
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,230
The South Pole

368
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,640
we take climbers to Mt. Vincent Massif base camp, and they climb

369
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,560
Mt. Vincent is just over here

370
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,650
We take people to see the Penguins out in Gold Bay

371
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,170
and Gold Bay where people go to the Emporer Penguin camp

372
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Those are some of the jobs we do here for ALE

373
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,619
Tom's GPS dance consists of:

374
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:14,739
swaying your hips while keeping a GPS steady hanging around your neck

375
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,320
I don't know
I can't explain it

376
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:18,469
It's a Tom-ism

377
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,359
Let's not ever do that again, please

378
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,000
Operation Time Machine

379
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,300
A top secret mission to fool the chef
into cooking lunch earlier than neccesary

380
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,520
It worked! He was very confused

381
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,320
What day is it today?

382
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,460
Due to the delayed plane

383
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,550
and the fairly mundane wine

384
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,590
We are creating port, by distilling the wine

385
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,600
by the natural process of freezing

386
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,700
and now centrifuging the alcohol and liquids

387
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,720
out of the ice to make it stronger

388
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,870
In 1959 representatives from a dozen
countries including the US and Russia

389
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:51,680
met in Washington to sign the Antarctic
Treaty it was an agreement that would make Antarctica free of weapons

390
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,730
keeping the continent reserved for
Scientific Research only

391
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,370
All the signatories vow to refrain from
making any claims to territory

392
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,140
today there are fifty states party
to the treaty

393
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,460
and in 1998 a protocol on
Environmental Protection came into force

394
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,500
It banned all commercial mining and
designated the whole continent as a nature reserve

395
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,900
Never before or since have nations agreed
to such a comprehensive and firm set of rules

396
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,250
to protect the environment have such a
large part of the world

397
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,040
Since the treaty was signed
investigations have been made into Antarctica's resources

398
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:34,810
Some suspect it to be the home of the
third largest oil reserve in the world

399
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,330
An estimated $200 billion barrels of oil

400
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,670
This oil is extremely difficult and at
the moment prohibitively expensive to extract

401
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,390
but in 2048 when the Antarctic
Treaty is open for review

402
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,680
and when drilling and mining techniques
may be more advanced

403
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,000
It is widely considered that the
long-standing ban on this practice will come to an end

404
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,930
and much like the warming Arctic north
there is a rush of human activity

405
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,830
to secure these possible reserves

406
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,390
In a world hungry for dwindling fossil
fuels

407
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,480
fresh water scarcity and soaring
energy needs

408
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,260
The very countries that signed the
Antarctic Treaty are spending lavishly to

409
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,420
explore the potential

410
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,980
on the world's last unexpoited continent

411
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:25,040
when a new Antarctic Treaty is drawn up
it will change the continent and the way we see it forever

412
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,300
Antarctica has been free of conflict and aggression

413
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:34,400
in a way that other parts of the world
have always desired. It has been a shelter for knowledge

414
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,880
and the attempt to understand the
changing planet we live on

415
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,560
It has also been a land of myth, of heroic
deeds and struggles

416
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,040
despite being so remote, so barren and
stark

417
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,990
It has become entangled in the search for
individual meaning and self-knowledge

418
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:52,160
amidst a fetish for exploration and
discovery

419
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,180
people have come to Antarctica to seek their nobility in the ice

420
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,460
And soon when it is seen only as a resource it will no longer give us meaning or knowledge

421
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,600
It will become just another part of the
globe, another asset rich territory

422
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,770
indistinguishable in all but appearance
from the rest of the world

423
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,370
that we sought to protect it from

424
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,250
The first Ilyushin flight has been
delayed by three weeks due to the bad weather

425
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,020
It has delayed the rest to the camp staff
from arriving

426
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,370
and also trapped Andy and I from
flying home

427
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,780
but when it does finally arrive,
regardless how exciting it may appear

428
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:34,189
it will be sad to leave

429
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,920
The best part of working in Anarctica is probably the close-knit team that we
have around here

430
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,780
Everybody seems to see things as the same goal, so when things go wrong

431
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,980
everybody just gets to it and generally gets the job done

432
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,870
Fine, easy we're all pretty much like-minded people who want to be here

433
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,900
It's one of the most stunning places in the world

434
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,480
It is probably the most beautiful place
I fly

435
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,030
Other than the Arctic. There are
close seconds for sure

436
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,720
but it's such a vast and beautiful,

437
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,730
beautiful, spot to be and see. I feel
very fortunate that

438
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,820
I get paid to see all these places that
others,

439
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,700
don't usually get a chance in their lifetime to see.

440
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,660
It's a really cool place

441
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,120
and you get to climb some mountains which have never been climbed before

442
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,240
and to work with some cool people

443
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,500
Every time I get up out of my tent it might be freezing cold, but I'm happy to be here.

444
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,200
Yeah, it's nice

445
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,960
Cameraman: And what's the best part of being in Antarctica and working here?

446
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,040
Well, point your camera out the window and have a look

447
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,820
Andy, what has been your most memorable
moment in the three weeks you've spent here?

448
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,860
When I was told the Ilyushin's coming

449
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,700
What are you most looking forward to? 

450
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
Maybe a beer

451
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,900
I dunno, I'm gonna miss you guys

452
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,210
about four hours

453
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:41,160
when the Ilyushin lands all the food,
fuel and other supplies for the camp will

454
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,330
be taken off the plane

455
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,310
and then it will be reloaded with waste
material for the return flight to Chile

456
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,240
The pilot will stay on the runway
for just two hours

457
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,670
so it'll be a very quick turnaround

458
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
It's a four and a half hour flight from Chile

459
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,120
and even though it could change
unexpectedly, the weather conditions are looking good

460
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,630
On-board the Ilyushin, looking through
the starboard window

461
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:15,440
and if the time of day is right, the moon
is visible hanging low in the sky

462
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,860
It drifts slowly up and down as the
aircraft passes through gentle winds in the atmosphere

463
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,320
The feeling of leaving antarctica

464
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,590
is though it was a cold distant moon or some other Frozen Planet

465
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,790
and it is a struggle to make sense and
of what it will mean

466
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:34,510
to get back home

467
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:46,920
Evening

468
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,760
This is my tent, this is where I'll be sleeping for the next three months

469
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,290
And this is the view I'll be looking at, it's amazing

470
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,980
The tag's got comfort -29

471
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,110
the limit of comfort -40

472
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:08,200
and extreme -67, allegedly

473
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:14,100
I quite like it when it's windy, it's 
like the tack on a sail, you can hear the

474
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,590
the tack clanging against the mast. I like to hear the tent

475
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:23,010
rattling around me. And I'm all wrapped up thinking: yeah I'm well cozy
